        <p>This game has yet to be listened to SCOTT! <br> But we basically escaped the raid on the warehouse, floated down teh river, stayed the day at the "shaky cup taven and B and B.
            Kurt ate some puppies and you took some documents from Desilvo and never asked what was on them. You made it to the Party at queen Annes gawdy skyscaprer, got in some fights then everyone got too drunk to do much else. actually a great game. </p>

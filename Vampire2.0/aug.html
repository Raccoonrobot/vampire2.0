        <p> Max played for tyler, was super creepy in game, def a preivous vampire. You calmed some fights, gained a hunting ground form Caleb. You stopped Adisa from going feral and now she will likely be an ally. The Queen told you her task in exchange fo rthe "Seal" is to MURDER Valarius, her sire. She is not too concenred with the seal, but seems to want info on what you know about Mithras. Oh and there was a weird flashback where you aiding Valarius in winning 
            the contest to be the baddest vamps so he could turn Anne. More details to come. </p>
